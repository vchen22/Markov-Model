Program Desciption:
This program generates texts based on what it predicts the following
word or character should occur next. To first get the prediction, the 
program reads a text file and creates a database that counts the number 
of occurences of words or characters followed by a certain 
character/words/phrases in that file. Then the program will attempt to
reproduce the given text by starting out with a character/word/phrase and 
search in the database to predict what possible word can be followed by 
the previous. This process is repeated until the desired number text is
satisfied.
